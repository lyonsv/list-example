# List View Example

This repo provides an example of a FlatList being used in Expo to sort and filter a list
of items from a mocked API.

# Highlights

- The filtering and sorting logic is included in the [useTeam hook](https://github.com/lyonsv/list-example/blob/master/hooks/teams.js).
- Our list is rendered using the [TeamList component](https://github.com/lyonsv/list-example/blob/master/components/TeamsList/index.js).

# Roadmap

- [] Move filtering and sorting logic into reducer.
- [] Test list component.
